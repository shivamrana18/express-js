 ### Hi , Shivam Rana this side. This is my practice project related to Express.js with Node.js.

 ### *What are we doing in this project ?*

 > Creating some API routes with help of Express framework

 > Using proper Error handling as per industry standards [actually they are my standards :-) ] 
 
 > Handling Params / Cookies / Headers in a request, basically using middleware here

 > Using controller methods here to maintain clean source code

 >Language used here is `Javascript`
